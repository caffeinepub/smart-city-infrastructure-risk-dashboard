Uses civil engineering risk formulas (Risk Score = f(Age, Load Factor, Material Factor, Environmental Factor)), ML-based deterioration modeling, GIS heatmap visualization, budget planning, and maintenance year prediction. Tech stack: React + Recharts/Chart.js + Leaflet.js (frontend), Node.js + Express (backend), Python Flask/FastAPI + scikit-learn (ML microservice), PostgreSQL (database). Inspired by government-level smart infrastructure systems like Singapore, Siemens, and Autodesk.",
